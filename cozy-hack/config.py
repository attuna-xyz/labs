PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = """
Julep is a platform for developing stateful and functional LLM-powered applications.
Why Julep?
We've built a lot of AI apps and understand how difficult it is to evaluate hundreds of tools, techniques, and models, and then make them work well together.
The Problems
The barrier to making LLM apps with memory, knowledge & tools is too high.
Agentic behavior is hard to control when done through multi-agent frameworks.
